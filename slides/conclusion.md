##  Conclusion

- Very different to each other
- I don't like them
- Rolling my own using Wisper and Virtus gems
- I'm waiting for Ruby Object Mapper

note:
    So in conclusion, they're very different to each other, in the both approach they take and how they work, and I
    don't like either of them, but for different reasons. For my own part, I'm trying to build a system which uses a
    combination of Wisper and Virtus gems to provide a Tell, don't ask interface, and waiting for Ruby Object Mapper to
    mature.
