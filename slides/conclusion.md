##  Conclusion

- Very different to each other
- I don't like them
- I'm waiting for Ruby Object Mapper

note:
    So in conclusion, they're very different to each other, in the both approach they take and how they work, and I
    don't like either of them, but for different reasons. For my own part, I'm waiting for Ruby Object Mapper to mature.
