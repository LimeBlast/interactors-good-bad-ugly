##  Why I don't like ActiveInteraction

- Painful to test
- Ask, don't tell

note:
    So that all sounds pretty good, right? Except there are a couple of things I dislike. The first is that they're very
    painful to test because they violate the single responsible principle by simply doing so much (validations, logic,
    etc..). The second thing, which is more of a nitpick, is they're not following the principle of tell, don't ask.
